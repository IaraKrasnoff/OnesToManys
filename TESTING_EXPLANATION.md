# Testing Strategy & Explanation - OnesToManys Project

## Why We Test Software

Imagine you're building a bridge. Would you open it to traffic without testing if it can hold the weight? Software is similar - we need to test every feature to make sure it works correctly before real users try it.

**What happens without tests:**
- Features break when you add new code
- Bugs reach real users
- You're never sure if changes broke something
- Problems are discovered in production (very bad!)

**What happens with good tests:**
- Confidence that features work as expected
- Catch bugs before users see them
- Safe to add new features
- Clear documentation of what the system should do

# Our Testing Architecture

## Test Categories in OnesToManys

### 1. **Unit Tests** (test_api.py)
**What they test**: Individual functions and endpoints in isolation
**Example**: "Does the create_order function correctly save an order to the database?"

### 2. **Integration Tests** (test_phase2.py)  
**What they test**: How different parts work together
**Example**: "When I create an order and then add items to it, does the total calculate correctly?"

### 3. **End-to-End Tests** (Manual testing with frontend)
**What they test**: Complete user workflows from start to finish
**Example**: "Can a user open the website, create an order, add items, and see the correct total?"

# Phase 1 Tests (test_api.py) - CRUD Operations

These tests verify that all basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations work correctly.

## Test: `test_create_order()`

### What It Tests
- Can we create a new order?
- Is the order saved to the database?
- Does the API return the created order with an assigned ID?

### Why It's Important
If we can't create orders, the entire system is useless! This is a fundamental operation.

### How It Works
```python
def test_create_order():
    # 1. ARRANGE: Prepare test data
    order_data = {
        "customer_id": 101,
        "order_date": "2025-08-12", 
        "total_amount": 0.0
    }
    
    # 2. ACT: Perform the operation we're testing
    response = client.post("/orders/", json=order_data)
    
    # 3. ASSERT: Check that it worked correctly
    assert response.status_code == 200  # HTTP 200 = Success
    created_order = response.json()
    assert created_order["customer_id"] == 101
    assert "order_id" in created_order  # Make sure ID was assigned
```

### What Could Go Wrong (Without This Test)
- Database connection fails → Orders aren't saved
- Data validation fails → Invalid orders get created
- API returns wrong format → Frontend breaks

## Test: `test_get_order()`

### What It Tests
- Can we retrieve a specific order by its ID?
- Does the returned data match what was originally saved?

### Why It's Important
Users need to view their order details. If retrieval fails, they can't see their orders.

### How It Works
```python
def test_get_order():
    # 1. ARRANGE: Create an order to test with
    order_data = {"customer_id": 102, "order_date": "2025-08-12"}
    create_response = client.post("/orders/", json=order_data)
    order_id = create_response.json()["order_id"]
    
    # 2. ACT: Try to retrieve the order
    response = client.get(f"/orders/{order_id}/")
    
    # 3. ASSERT: Check we got the right order back
    assert response.status_code == 200
    retrieved_order = response.json()
    assert retrieved_order["customer_id"] == 102
    assert retrieved_order["order_id"] == order_id
```

### Real-World Scenario
"Customer calls: 'I can't see my order #123!' → This test ensures order lookup works."

## Test: `test_get_all_orders()`

### What It Tests
- Can we retrieve a list of all orders?
- Are all orders included in the response?

### Why It's Important
Business needs reports showing all orders. Admin users need to see order lists.

### How It Works
```python
def test_get_all_orders():
    # 1. ARRANGE: Create multiple test orders
    client.post("/orders/", json={"customer_id": 101, "order_date": "2025-08-12"})
    client.post("/orders/", json={"customer_id": 102, "order_date": "2025-08-13"})
    
    # 2. ACT: Get all orders
    response = client.get("/orders/")
    
    # 3. ASSERT: Check we got both orders
    assert response.status_code == 200
    orders = response.json()
    assert len(orders) >= 2  # At least our test orders exist
```

## Test: `test_update_order()`

### What It Tests
- Can we modify an existing order?
- Are the changes saved correctly?

### Why It's Important
Customers change their minds: "I want to change my delivery address!"

### How It Works
```python
def test_update_order():
    # 1. ARRANGE: Create an order to modify
    original = {"customer_id": 101, "order_date": "2025-08-12"}
    create_response = client.post("/orders/", json=original)
    order_id = create_response.json()["order_id"]
    
    # 2. ACT: Update the order
    updated = {"customer_id": 201, "order_date": "2025-08-15"}
    response = client.put(f"/orders/{order_id}/", json=updated)
    
    # 3. ASSERT: Check the update worked
    assert response.status_code == 200
    updated_order = response.json()
    assert updated_order["customer_id"] == 201  # Changed!
```

## Test: `test_delete_order()`

### What It Tests
- Can we remove an order from the system?
- Is the order actually gone after deletion?

### Why It's Important
Cancelled orders need to be removed. GDPR compliance may require data deletion.

### How It Works
```python
def test_delete_order():
    # 1. ARRANGE: Create an order to delete
    order_data = {"customer_id": 101, "order_date": "2025-08-12"}
    create_response = client.post("/orders/", json=order_data)
    order_id = create_response.json()["order_id"]
    
    # 2. ACT: Delete the order
    response = client.delete(f"/orders/{order_id}/")
    
    # 3. ASSERT: Check deletion worked
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # 4. VERIFY: Order is actually gone
    get_response = client.get(f"/orders/{order_id}/")
    assert get_response.status_code == 404  # Not Found
```

---

# Phase 2 Tests (test_phase2.py) - Advanced Features

These tests verify the enhanced features we added in Phase 2.

## Test: `test_enhanced_relationship_endpoints()`

### What It Tests
- Can we get all items for a specific order?
- Can we add items directly to an order?
- Do the master-detail relationships work correctly?

### Why It's Important
This is the core of our "One-to-Many" relationship. Orders contain multiple items.

### Real-World Scenario
"Show me all the items in order #123" or "Add 2 more t-shirts to my existing order"

### How It Works
```python
def test_enhanced_relationship_endpoints():
    # 1. Create an order
    order_response = client.post("/orders/", json={
        "customer_id": 101, 
        "order_date": "2025-08-12"
    })
    order_id = order_response.json()["order_id"]
    
    # 2. Add items to the order using the enhanced endpoint
    item_data = {
        "product_id": 1001,
        "quantity": 2, 
        "unit_price": 25.99
    }
    item_response = client.post(f"/orders/{order_id}/items/", json=item_data)
    
    # 3. Verify the item was added correctly
    assert item_response.status_code == 200
    
    # 4. Get all items for this order
    items_response = client.get(f"/orders/{order_id}/items/")
    items = items_response.json()
    
    # 5. Verify we got our item back
    assert len(items) == 1
    assert items[0]["product_id"] == 1001
    assert items[0]["quantity"] == 2
```

## Test: `test_order_summary_endpoint()`

### What It Tests
- Can we get calculated totals and statistics for an order?
- Are the calculations correct?

### Why It's Important
Users want to see: "Order total: $127.50, Contains 5 items, Average price: $25.50"

### How It Works
```python
def test_order_summary_endpoint():
    # 1. Create order with multiple items
    order_response = client.post("/orders/", json={...})
    order_id = order_response.json()["order_id"]
    
    # Add item 1: 2 units × $10.00 = $20.00
    client.post(f"/orders/{order_id}/items/", json={
        "product_id": 1, "quantity": 2, "unit_price": 10.00
    })
    
    # Add item 2: 3 units × $15.00 = $45.00  
    client.post(f"/orders/{order_id}/items/", json={
        "product_id": 2, "quantity": 3, "unit_price": 15.00
    })
    
    # 2. Get order summary
    response = client.get(f"/orders/{order_id}/summary/")
    summary = response.json()
    
    # 3. Verify calculations
    assert summary["total_amount"] == 65.00    # $20 + $45
    assert summary["total_items"] == 5         # 2 + 3 units
    assert summary["average_item_price"] == 13.00  # $65 ÷ 5
```

## Test: `test_json_export_endpoint()`

### What It Tests
- Can we export all data to JSON format?
- Is the exported data complete and valid?

### Why It's Important
Business needs: "Export all our data for backup/analysis/migration"

### How It Works
```python
def test_json_export_endpoint():
    # 1. Create test data
    # ... create orders and items ...
    
    # 2. Export to JSON
    response = client.get("/export/orders/json/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # 3. Verify export format
    export_data = response.json()
    assert "orders" in export_data
    assert "order_items" in export_data
    assert len(export_data["orders"]) > 0
```

## Test: `test_error_handling_relationship_endpoints()`

### What It Tests
- What happens when we try invalid operations?
- Are error messages helpful?

### Why It's Important
Users make mistakes: "Add item to order #999 (doesn't exist)" → Should get clear error message

### How It Works
```python
def test_error_handling_relationship_endpoints():
    # 1. Try to add item to non-existent order
    response = client.post("/orders/999/items/", json={
        "product_id": 1, "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 10.00
    })
    
    # 2. Should get 404 error
    assert response.status_code == 404
    assert "Order not found" in response.json()["detail"]
```

# Testing Best Practices We Follow

## 1. **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
```python
def test_something():
    # ARRANGE: Set up test data
    test_data = {...}
    
    # ACT: Perform the operation
    result = function_under_test(test_data)
    
    # ASSERT: Check the result
    assert result.is_correct()
```

## 2. **Independent Tests**
Each test creates its own data and cleans up afterward. Tests don't depend on each other.

## 3. **Clear Test Names**
`test_create_order()` is better than `test1()` - you immediately know what's being tested.

## 4. **Test Both Success and Failure**
- Happy path: "What happens when everything works correctly?"
- Sad path: "What happens when things go wrong?"

## 5. **Fast Feedback**
Our tests run in seconds, so developers get quick feedback on their changes.

# Test Coverage Report

When you run `pytest --cov`, you get a report showing which lines of code are tested:

```
Name                    Stmts   Miss  Cover
-------------------------------------------
main.py                   120      5    96%
database.py               85       3    96%
data_manager.py           45       2    96%
-------------------------------------------
TOTAL                     250     10    96%
```

**What this means:**
- 96% of our code is tested
- Only 10 lines out of 250 are not covered by tests
- Very high confidence that our code works correctly

# Real-World Testing Scenarios

## Scenario 1: New Developer Joins Team
**Problem**: "I'm afraid to change this code - what if I break something?"
**Solution**: Run the tests! If they all pass, your changes didn't break existing functionality.

## Scenario 2: Customer Reports a Bug
**Problem**: "Orders with special characters in customer names are failing"
**Solution**: 
1. Write a test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code until the test passes
3. Now we have a permanent guard against this bug

## Scenario 3: Adding New Feature
**Problem**: "We need to add tax calculation to orders"
**Solution**:
1. Write tests for the new feature first (Test-Driven Development)
2. Implement the feature until all tests pass
3. Refactor/optimize while tests ensure functionality stays intact

## Scenario 4: Database Migration
**Problem**: "We need to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL"
**Solution**: Our tests verify that all operations still work with the new database.

---

# Testing in Production Systems

## Continuous Integration (CI)
In real companies, tests run automatically whenever code is pushed:

```yaml
# Example CI pipeline
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Automated system runs all tests
3. If tests pass → Code can be deployed
4. If tests fail → Deployment is blocked
```

## Test Types in Enterprise Systems

1. **Unit Tests** (what we built) - Test individual functions
2. **Integration Tests** (what we built) - Test component interactions  
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests** - Test system under load
5. **Security Tests** - Test for vulnerabilities
6. **Browser Tests** - Test UI in different browsers
